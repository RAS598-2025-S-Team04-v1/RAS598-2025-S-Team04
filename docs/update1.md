## Canges in goal statement

Previously we were of the idea of using a UR5 to test the repeatability and drop test our quadruped with an added ankle attachment for stability. But considering the timeline and limitations, we changed our goal statement to analyzing the position, orientation via OptiTrack and Force via force gauge. We will be physically dropping testing a part of the quadruped for the study. Sensor data which is filtered will be further analyzed and added as a simulation parameter for a MujoCo simulation adding on to research done by Prof. Aukes.
